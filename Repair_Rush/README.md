Source code is compiled using the SDL library

Something like 
```sudo apt install libsdl2-dev```
is needed to add the compile libraries to your system.

The command 
```make```
will compile and run the executable.  The executable name has a .exe extension so the Makefiles don't need to add and remove the .exe based on platform.
